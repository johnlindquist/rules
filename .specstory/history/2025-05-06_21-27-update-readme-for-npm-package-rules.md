# Update README for npm package rules (2025-05-06 15:27:39)

_**User**_

@https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-rules 
@README.md 

Please update the readme with the primary way of getting these rules as this npm package.

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I will update the `README.md` to feature the `get-rules` npm package as the primary method for downloading the rules, while retaining the `curl` and PowerShell methods as alternatives.

I will first read the content of `README.md` to understand its current structure.

---

Model provided invalid arguments to read file tool.

---

My apologies, I made an error in the previous step. I'll try reading the file again with the correct parameters.

---

Read file: README.md

---

Now that I have the content of `README.md`, I will edit it to prioritize the `get-rules` npm package.

The `README.md` has been updated to reflect the `get-rules` npm package as the primary method. The existing script-based methods are now listed as alternatives. I've also updated the "Updating Rules" and "What do the manual scripts do?" sections accordingly.
