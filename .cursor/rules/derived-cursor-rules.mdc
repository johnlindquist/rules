## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

This section outlines the structure and management of project documentation.  All documentation should be stored in a consistent format and location to ensure easy access and maintainability.

### SpecStory Management

All `.specstory` files should be ignored by Git to prevent accidental commits.  To remove existing `.specstory` files from Git tracking without deleting them from the local system, use the following commands:

```bash
git rm -r --cached .specstory/
```

For individual files within `.specstory`, use the following command:

```bash
rm '.specstory/filename.md'
```

After removing files from git tracking, commit and push changes using:

```bash
git commit -am 'chore: remove .specstory from git tracking and update .gitignore'
git push
```
To add all unstaged changes, commit, and push:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m 'chore: commit all un-staged changes' && git push
```
